This repository contains code to recreate the figures from "Limiting hearing loss in transgenic mouse models" by Babola, Donovan, Darcey, and Kanold (2024-ish). Each figure is broken into it's own folder, with subsequent panels indicated in the file name.

In order to succesfully recreate figures, the corresponding data can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13761405) and placed within the repository to run properly. If a custom location is desired, this can be specified in the [config file.](/Code/Travis/config.py).
