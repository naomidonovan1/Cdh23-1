This repository contains code to recreate the figures from "Limiting hearing loss in transgenic mouse models" by Babola, Donovan, Darcey, and Kanold (2024-ish). Each figure is broken into it's own folder, with subsequent panels indicated in the file name. Figure generation and analysis was primarily done using iPython notebooks and standalone .py files.
